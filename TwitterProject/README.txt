For running this project using custom test dataset
- Delete clean_data.csv & real_data.csv - they will be generated by the pre-processing file
1.  please open "pre_process.ipynb" - scroll down to 9th cell containing the line
    "test_set = pd.read_csv('unclean_sample.csv',engine="python")"
    Modify 'unclean_sample.csv' to your test file's name and put that file within this directory
	*assumption* the test data set is formatted exactly like the training set given*

2. Then click run all cells - which will take a couple of mins to generate all the word lists
    and clean the data and generate 2 datasets called "clean_data.csv" (training) and "realdata.csv" (test)
   for classification.

3. Open "classification.ipynb" next. Just click run all cells and scroll down to 2nd to last cell to see
   accuracy rates for each given model. 
4. The last cell's print statements are just for anaylsis purpose on the training set to determine some
   parameters.
